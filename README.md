# JavaLearningJourney

Welcome to my Java learning adventure! This repository is my personal space where I dive deep into Java, exploring its many facets through hands-on projects, fun coding challenges, and practical exercises. Every commit here marks a step forward in my journey towards mastering Java, as I embrace a mindset of continuous learning and growth.

## Purpose
This repository is a reflection of my dedication to learning and mastering Java. Inside, you’ll find a variety of exercises, projects, and experiments that showcase my progress and growing understanding of the language. Each section is thoughtfully organized to cover different concepts, ranging from the basics to more advanced programming techniques.

## Structure
- **01-Introduction**: Start with the fundamentals—basic syntax, variables, data types, and control flow.
- **02-Control-Flow**: Dive into conditionals, loops, and exception handling.
- **03-OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Explore the world of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **04-Data Structures**: Get hands-on with arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and more.
- **05-Projects**: Tackle small projects that tie everything together and showcase practical Java applications.
